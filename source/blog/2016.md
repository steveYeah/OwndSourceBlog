# 2016 - Time to start writing
I've been meaning to get a blog up and running for about 5 years, but never really had the time to 
get things going. Now blog platforms, such as PyKwiki (the one I'm using now), make things so easy 
I no longer have an excuse not to start writing things down, so here we go!

### So, Why bother?
I spend a lot of time reading, hacking and learning new things. Sometimes I do this as it helps out
at work, but mostly I do it just for the interest. That's great and all, but after I've spent hours 
and hours on something the knowledge might just sit in my brain and slowly fade away. With these 
posts I hope to preserve the knowledge, and share it with anyone interested.

Well, that's it for now. Hopefully lots of posts to come. Hope you have a good 2016!
